// Level Scenes - draws a scene image depending on what engine tells it


function Draw( currentlvl)
{ 
// If currentlvl is valid, draw it
// update and draw 

}

// Moves player sprite in the scene according to where clicked
function MovePlayer()
{
	// Animates player moving along path
	// Determines location then calls player's draw
}

// Also use class for mini-screens so we can pop up things without switching levels
